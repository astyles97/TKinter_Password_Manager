# TKinter_Password_Manager
A simple introduction to encryption while making a GUI using the TKinter module in Python.

This is a project from Dr. Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: Python".

The "hash" is generated from random selection of character within a list of a preset length.
It will create a JSON of your passwords within a file named "receipts".
